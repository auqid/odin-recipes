<h2>Description</h2>
<p>American goulash was one of my all-time favorite comfort food meals when I was growing up. </p>
<p>They served it in my school cafeteria alongside a slice of buttered white bread and a carton of milk. </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>ground beef</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>2 large bay leaves</li>
    <li>Fresh Herbs</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onion; cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.  </li>
    <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 3 minutes. Pour in broth, marinara sauce, and diced tomatoes. Pour water into the sauce jar, swirl, and pour into the pot. Stir in soy sauce; bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until flavors intensify, about 30 minutes. </li>
    <li>Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a rapid simmer. Stir in macaroni; cook, stirring occasionally, until just barely tender, about 12 minutes. Check for doneness after 10 minutes.  </li>
